# üì¶ Installation

BYVFX Tools uses Houdini's package management system for seamless integration into your pipeline. The package system ensures that all tools, HDAs, and resources are properly organized and loaded in your Houdini environment.

## Using Houdini Packages

1. Create a `packages` directory in your Houdini preferences if it doesn't exist:

```bash
# Windows
%USERPROFILE%/Documents/HOUDINIVERSION/packages

# Linux
~/HOUDINIVERSION/packages

# macOS
~/Library/Preferences/houdini/HOUDINIVERSION/packages
```

1. Download the BYVFX Tools package and extract it to a location of your choice:

2. Create a new JSON file named `BYVFX.json` in your packages directory with the following content or use the one provided:

```json
{
    "enable" : true,
    "env": 
    
       [ {"HOUDINI_PATH" : "E:\\_houdiniFiles\\BY_python\\byvfx_tools"}]

}
```

### Verifying Installation

After installing, you can verify the setup by:

1. Opening Houdini and checking the package is loaded:

```python
# Run in Python Shell
hou.packageRegistry().packages()
```

1. Checking environment variables:

```python
# Run in Python Shell
import os
print(os.getenv("BYVFX"))
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Verify your `HOUDINI_PATH` includes the package directory
2. Check that all environment variables are properly set
3. Ensure file permissions are correct
4. Restart Houdini after making changes
